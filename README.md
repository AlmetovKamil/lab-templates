# Lab Templates

Here you can find templates for home assignments. Typically they consist of C, Bash, and text files that you have to fill in.

**Note**: only the files specified in the template (and the files they reference) will be checked by the instructor. If your solution logic is split among several files not included in the template, it is your responsibility to make sure they work together (typically through a Bash script that will be included in the template).

## Guidelines

* Make sure that your code is readable - that means that the brackets and parenthesis are aligned, the blocks, procedures,  loops, etc. have indentations and so on.
* Be concise with the theoretical questions.
* Have fun with the course! If you have any difficulties you are welcome to contact the course instructors.
